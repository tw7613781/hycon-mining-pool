# Roadmap

<p class="description">The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the list below should give some indication of our plans for the next major release, and for the future.</p>

Our priorities:
1. **Security**. We want to ensure that `hycon-core` and all its related packages and applications are secure from attacks and vulnerabilities.
1. **Performance & Scalability**. After ensuring the security of the network to the best of our ability, we want to optimize the network's transaction throughput and our platform's adoptability. The team constantly thinks about ways to improve Hycon, and plans to share any relevant findings. Any help is welcome!
1. **Utility**. We want to prioritize the most important tasks first, with the two above points being the highest priorities, followed by expanding the use case of Hycon in the public space. We also want to work with anyone who wants to integrate Hycon into their idea. 
1. **Community**. We want to support our community, and would like to create events around developing Hycon and its platform, as well as events to show our appreciation to our community's support.
1. **Technical Debt**. We want to refactor and create better tests for our existing code and redesign many of our applications. There are also some dependencies we'd like to ugprade as well!
1. **Design & Documentation**. We want to translate the documentation into other languages. We also want to make our applications more user-friendly, especially for those who don't have any technical background. Any help is welcomed!
